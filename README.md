This project aims to create a home helper robot. Initial goals for this robot's capabilities include:

1. Ability to navigate freely around the home
2. Ability to handle terrain obstacles, such as stairs, doorsteps, various types of flooring/rugs/carpets
3. Ability to dynamically maintain balance in case of collisions
4. Ability to recognise objects
5. Ability to handle objects - a set of at least two manipulators
6. Ability to transport objects while balancing them - for example a plate of soup without spilling
